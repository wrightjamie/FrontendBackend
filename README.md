# Agentic Project Template

This repository serves as a baseline template for future projects. It establishes the folder structure, norms, and agentic workflow files necessary for an AI-assisted development environment.

**Note:** This repository is a template and does not perform any functional logic itself. It is intended to be forked or copied to start new projects with a standardized foundation.

## Contents

- `AGENT.md`: Operational rules for the AI agent.
- `NORMS.md`: Coding conventions and project standards.
- `TODO.md`: Centralized task tracking.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Record of changes to the template.

## Version

Current Baseline: **Version 1.0**
