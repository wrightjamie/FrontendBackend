Data tables will be editable in the admin dashboard.
They will be under a data tab
Each data type will have its own table. Let's use another set of tabs for this.
Each data type will have a format. I'll let you decide what that looks like, but maybe a JSON format stored in the database?
It will have a set of fields
Fields will have a name, type, and description
They may be required or optional
Fields may have a default value
For now, let's have a text field, a number field, a boolean field, options and a date field. We may add more later.
Data in a type may also be ordered. If it is ordered, we will be able to reorder the data in the admin dashboard.
We should be able to add / delete / edit / reorder (if appropriate)data.
Some data types may prevent add / delete / edit / reorder.
